## My process

### Built with
- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned
1. I wasn't sure which should I use `<h1>` or `<h2>` about some texts.  <br>
Finally I use the both tag as below, but I haven't understood what the bestpractice yet.  <br>
``<h1>PERFUME</h1>``  <br>
``<h2>Gabrielle Essence Eau De Parfum</h2>``

2. It was a great learning experience how to put a component on center the screen.  <br>
Especially how to center of screen vertically.  <br>
Finally, I used `display:flex` and `align-items:center` without setting height.

### Continued development
When I'm looking back, I have not write my code of Components yet.  <br>
I want to experience more patterns through the Frontend Mentor challenges.
